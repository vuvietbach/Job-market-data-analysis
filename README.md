## Analysis Results

### What is the typical salary range for IT jobs?
![IT Salary Range](assets/IT_salary.png)

The graph shows that most job postings do not specify a fixed salary, noting instead that the salary is negotiable. The most common salary range is between 10 million and 30 million VND, which aligns with our expectations (considering both the 10-20 and 20-30 million ranges). However, it's surprising to find that the number of jobs offering a salary of 30 to 50 million VND is higher than for any other range. This contradicts the expectation that lower-salary jobs should be more prevalent.

### How does the number of years of experience correlate with salary?
![Experience vs Salary](assets/experience_vs_salary.png)

There is a positive correlation between years of experience and salary. An IT specialist with 4 to 6 years of experience can expect a salary between 50 and 56 million VND, while those with 7 years of experience earn an average of 62 million VND. Professionals with more than 8 years of experience can earn an average of over 90 million VND.

### What are the common IT positions, and how many job openings are available for each type?

The most common IT positions are related to software development, including web developers, testers, software developers, and mobile developers. Data-related positions (e.g., data engineers, data scientists, data analysts) have the second-highest number of job openings, reflecting the growing demand in this area. Other IT positions have job postings ranging from 25 to over 100.

### What level of experience is typically required for IT roles?
![Experience Levels Required](assets/experience_levels_required.png)
